   <title>Retrying</title>
   <body>
      <p>There are cases in which you should keep retrying to scan a file, for example when you get the status <b>IN_PROGRESS</b> for a file. This status means that someone uploaded that file and it is being analyzed in the cloud. In this case, you should use the returned <b>ttl</b> value as a "retry after ttl seconds" measure. Likewise, if your application itself uploads a file, the same process applies. Limits should be set for the number of retries, for the maximum <b>ttl</b> value to be taken into consideration (for example, "do not retry after 1 week, if ttl says so"), etc.</p>
